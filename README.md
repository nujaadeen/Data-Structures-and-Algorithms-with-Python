# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python

Welcome to my repository containing Jupyter notebook scripts for studying data structures and algorithms using Python. This collection of notebooks serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding fundamental concepts and implementing various algorithms efficiently.

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebook scripts covering a wide range of topics related to data structures and algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Binary Search
- Binary Search Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables and Dictionaries
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting
- Divide and Conquer

Each notebook provides detailed explanations, code implementations, and examples to illustrate the concepts discussed. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced programmer aiming to enhance your skills, these notebooks are designed to cater to all levels of proficiency.
